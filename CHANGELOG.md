- Initial design and requirements
- Update the application title, icon, assets ...

## 28/06/2024
- added support for master/details view. Instead of using the CommunityToolkit generated code we use the framework described in: https://xamlbrewer.wordpress.com/2022/02/07/building-a-master-detail-page-with-winui-3-and-mvvm/
This has some additional features: filter/search on the list; app command bar; listview items with icon(s).
- initial check in.
